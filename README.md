# Earned-Value-Tool
Are you studying for the PMI-PMP Exam? Are you facing difficulty to understand project Earned Value?  If so, here is a good tool to help you out.This tool emulates "The Fence" exercise and prompts you to insert project values like: budget, working day, money spent on each side of the fence.  You will be also prompted to insert calculations like: BAC, PV, EV, AC, etc.. Once inserted all the necessary data, you can check your answers by clicking on a submit button.
